<h2>1. TROUBLESHOOTING BACK PAIN</h2>
<p><span>If you've tried the Bub's Pillow for a few nights and notice that you're waking up with back pain, there are a
        few reasons why this could be:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Your pillows are too close together - too much wedge on your back</span></p>

<h2>2. TROUBLESHOOTING HIP/PELVIC PAIN</h2>
<p><span>If you've tried been using the Bub's Pillow but you still can't seem to get rid of hip and/or pelvic pain, this
        could be due to a number reasons beyond the pillow. </span></p>
<p><span>The Bub's Pillow helps reduce hip &amp; pelvic pain from sleeping in uncomfortable positions - however, not all
        hip pain in pregnancy comes from sleeping (in fact, most of it doesn't!)</span></p>
<p><span>Some moms will find that the Bub's Pillow is enough, others will need extra support.</span></p>
<p><strong>The quickest way to help alleviate hip and pelvis discomfort at night is by adding enough cushioning between
        your legs so that your top leg is in a straight angle with your body,</strong> rather than falling toward your
    lower leg.</p>
<p><span>This is because with your pelvis loosening up its joints and ligaments to prepare for birth (thanks,
        hormones!), when sleeping on your side the weight of your upper leg will force your pelvis into an uncomfortable
        and unnecessary flexion over your body.</span></p>

                against your bottom leg. It needs to be clearly seen that the upper leg is NOT in a straight angle with
                your spine, hence adding pressure to your hips and pelvis.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>While the Auxiliary Pillow that comes with your Bub's Pillow provides some support, you may find more relief by
        using a thicker pillow that keeps your legs farther apart.</span></p>

                a slight angle on your upper leg vs your spine.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>A regular pillow may be used between your legs. If this helps, then congratulations! Problem solved, now it's
        time to sleep...</span></p>

                legs, showing a straighter angle with the spine</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>However, in our experience <strong>regular pillows can often get too hot,&nbsp;</strong>and sometimes itchy. If
        you can't seem to find a pillow that works for you, our breathable Bub's Full Body Attachment could be the
        perfect match for extra support on your legs, back, or front.</span></p>

<h2>3. TROUBLESHOOTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE</h2>
<p><span>If you feel like the Bub's Pillow is adding too much pressure to your bump and/or back, there could be a number
        of reasons with easy solutions:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Your pillows are too close together - too much pressure on your bump</span></p>

            a bit of fiddling - don't worry, it will all be worth it when you get it right!</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. TROUBLESHOOTING&nbsp;NOT ENOUGH SUPPORT</h2>
<p><span>If you feel like the pillows aren't providing enough support to either your bump or back;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Your pillows may be too far apart - too little wedge under your belly and back </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. TROUBLESHOOTING&nbsp;PILLOW TOO FIRM</h2>
<p><span>If you have already tried adjusting the length of the pillow, but you still feel like it is too firm and
        uncomfortable on your back or bump, you may benefit from adjusting the firmness of the pillow. See how:</span>
</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff2a00;"><em><strong>Clip on how to remove stuffing</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>1)&nbsp;Unzip the cover of the pillow that feels too firm (front, back, or both)</span></p>
<p><span>2) Unzip the inner pillow and remove a small handful of stuffing</span></p>
<p><span>3) Zip it back up &amp; fluff the pillows nicely to get them back to shape before laying on them again</span>
</p>
<p><em><strong>Note: If you find that the pillow on your bump is too firm while the one on your back doesn't support
            enough, you can transfer some stuffing from one to the other. Keep in mind this will limit you to sleeping
            on one side only, or having to move the pillow entirely when you switch sides.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Note 2: We recommend you take small amounts of filling each time so you can find the perfect support for
            you. This may take a bit of fiddling - don't worry, it will all be worth it when you get it
            right!</strong></em></p>
